## Requirements
Some codes in this repo are copied/modified from opensource implementations made available by [DeiT repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/deit), and installation & preparation follow that repo.
 - PyTorch 1.8.1+
 - timm==0.3.2 

We support Linux with NVIDIA GPUs. We test on Ubuntu 18.04 and RTX 3090 cards. We use mixed-precision training hence GPUs with Tensor Cores are recommended.

## Quick Start
